# Style Transfer

Task 5: Style transfer of famous artists using CNN network
(Python),
Description: Compose images in the style of another
image,
Network: based on VGG19,
Tensorflow tutorial:

Image database:

Remarks: Test (and if necessary train) on your own
images and styles of at least 2 different artists. Check the
influence of using different number of intermediate layers
and in different location of network structure.

Project parts:
Theory:
1 title page + 1 table of content page,
10 - 20 pages - about: purpose of the work, description
of the method and description of its implementation,
obtained results and short summary,
1 bibliography page - at least 5 positions.
Program - code with comments. It has to contain all the
necessary elements needed to run it, e.g. list of used
libraries and images.
Project elements:
15 minute Presentation in January. The order of the
presentation in accordance with the date of handing over
the work. The maximum number of presentations during
project classes is 3.
The project is written in groups of 2 people.
For task you can achieve 10 points:
Theory: 0 - 4 points,
Program: 0 - 4 points,
Presentation and questions: -2 - 2 points (negative
points),
The project deadline is 24.12.2020 (theory + program).
Each week of delay: -1 point,
10 points corresponds to 100%.
Final Neural Network subject grad:
0.7 * Test grade + 0.3 * Project grade
